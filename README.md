# To Do Tracker (Ruby Edition)

The primary function of this project is to allow an authenticated user to track their To Do list and items in one
convenient place.

Tangentially,
this project showcases the project structure I use when creating applications using the
[Sinatra](http://sinatrarb.com/)
framework and the [Model, View, Controller (MVC)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model-view-controller)
design pattern.
